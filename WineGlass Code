//Create method for the flute
//In the flute, print out an asterisk
//then create for loop for the spaces where the space is equal to the SIZE
//then print out an asterisk after the spaces
//Next, create a method for the bases
//In the bases, add a for loop that says to print out asterisks and the amount is the SIZE plus 2
//Next, create a method for the stem
//In the stem, create a for loop that prints out the number of space that is the SIZE plus 1 then divide that by 2
//Then print out an asterisk after that
//Create the main methos
//In the main, first create a for loop that repeats all the code to print the glasses that is equal to the number that's inputted
//Next, create a for loop for the number of lines for the flute
//It should have the number of lines equal to the SIZE for the flute
//Next, print out the bases
//Then, create a for loop for the number of lines for the stem
//It should have the number of lines equal to the SIZE for the stem
//Then, print out the bases
//Now, create the last method, which is where you use the number and SIZE that were inputted and add it to the code
//Next call 2 example sizes for the drawGlasses(number, SIZE) methods and include it at the end of the main
